# KiiPay – Blockchain Payments Made Simple

### Democratizing Blockchain Payments for Businesses of All Sizes

---

## 📌 Introduction

KiiPay is a Web3 payment integration solution built on the Internet Computer (ICP), designed to empower businesses of all sizes to adopt secure, fast, and intuitive blockchain payments without technical complexity.

While blockchain offers transformative potential, its steep learning curve keeps many businesses on the sidelines. KiiPay bridges this gap, offering a plug-and-play payment SDK and a user-friendly dashboard to manage products, transactions, and analytics—all while leveraging the power of ICP.
